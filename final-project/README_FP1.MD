Write-up:
The goal of this project is to simulate what it would be like if generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc. offered responses with visual information. Currently, responses are entirely text-based, which is a disservice users to the many users that are visual learners. This website would allow users to enter questions (using pre-loaded options), and would then display answers to said questions that contain both written and image- or gif-based content.

Users will interact with the website by askng questions: User selects a topic from pre-loaded dropdow, then select a sub-topic, then select a specific question (For example - Topic area 1: “I want to learn more about… cities…” → Option 1: “I want to learn more about city size” → Question A: “how big is New York City compared to Los Angeles?"). The website will engage users by providing responses, similar to GenAI chat interfaces like ChatGPT. However the responses will contain both text- and image-based content. Unlike ChatGPT, the responses will not be generated ad-hoc. Rather, each question will correspond with a pre-loaded response that will be called from a library.

I will use WCAG accessibility guidelines surrounding visual elements, assistive techology support, and cognitive accessibility to ensure that the site is usable, engaging, and desirable for a broad range of users.

I want my site to convey information that is more concrete and some that is conceptual. Concretely, I want to display information around 3 topics that I'm nerdy about, including: city/urban planning, air travel + transit; biology. On a conceptual level, I want this site to serve as a meditation or proposal on how GenAI tools might provide information in a more engaging and memorable way.


IDEA 2

Write-up:
The goal of this site is to enhance a deliverable I built for an existing client. I work with a client who requested a PDF-based guest manual for her rental property, which she will send out to prospective and committed guests. However, PDFs lead to a poor user experience due to visual crowding, restrictions on providing progressive information, etc. So I want to build a website that offers the same content with the elevated user experience of a modern website.

Users will interact with the design via traditional interactions (clicks, scrolls, drags). I want to introduce interactions that are specifically useful for someone planning or on a trip (e.g., user can drag a trip recommendation into a saved folder or into a tool that allows them to send the item to family members via email or SMS).

I will use WCAG accessibility guidelines surrounding visual elements, assistive techology support, and cognitive accessibility to ensure that the site is usable, engaging, and desirable for a broad range of users. Because travel sites can be extremely information-dense, I'll pay close attention to reducing visual crowding on a given page, and harnessing progressive information via click-activated embedded pages and cards.

The most important information I want to provide to users is as follows: Firstly, the 101 information on how to get settled at the rental property (e.g., parking info, wifi info, emergency planning, etc.). Secondly, I want users who are feeling decision fatigue or intimated by trip planning to be able to look at the site and gain inspiration and inspiration for fun day trips.

IDEA 3

Write-up:
The goal of this site is to display my design projects in a web-based portfolio (it currently exists as a PDF), which will help with my job application process.

I will use traditional interactions (e.g., click, scroll, etc.) to help users engage with the content. I will also use interactions that help highlight the spirit of each project (e.g., more abrupt/striking transitions to signal stages in the design process that were surprising or urgent; calmer transitions to signal a denoument or resolution).

I will use WCAG accessibility guidelines surrounding visual elements, assistive techology support, and cognitive accessibility to ensure that the site is usable, engaging, and desirable for a broad range of users. Because portfolios sites can be extremely information-dense, I'll pay close attention to reducing visual crowding on a given page, and harnessing progressive information via click-activated embedded pages and cards.

The most important information I want to provide to users is as follows: I want readers to understand the unique skills and perspective that my non-traditional background (consulting, strategy) has brought to my design process. secondly, I want readers to easily glean when I made a choice that was divergent or controversial, as well as the rationales and impacts of those decisions.


SUMMARY OF IN-CLASS CRITIQUE:

There were a few themes in the critique I received during lab. Firstly, classmates and instructor shared that my first idea might be difficult to implement from a technical perspective. Because the visual content would feature moving imagery, it could be difficult to code the visuals with true-to-life physics and movement patterns. Secondly, my classmates and instructor advised that there are challenges with building a site that approximates LLMs without behaving as an LLM itself. Because I plan to let users select from pre-loaded questions, and receive answers using pre-loaded data, it is likely that users will feel limited autonomy on the website.

On concept two, feedback from my classmates and instructor primarily centered around the potential benefits of building a website for an existing client. Firstly, I already have a pdf-version of the content. This could allow me to get a head-start on creating user stories, planning the site's information architecture and visual layout, and building/testing low-fi prototypes with users. Secondly, given the project timeline, I would hopefully be able to deliver my client an MVP by the end of the semester, and would have the space to iterate on this and build an incrementally better site after the course concludes. This would be constructive for my learning and for my client.

I did not receive in-class critique on my third website idea.

SYNTHESIS OF CRITIQUE AND NEXT STEPS:

The feedback about idea 2 (guest manual for client) is especially salient. I share my classmates' and instructor's sentiment that building a website for an existing client will accelerate my building process, deliver measurable value to real-world users, and facilitate my long-term learning. For these reasons, idea 2 feels like the strongest contender in terms of satisfying the needs of this specific project and I would follow my classmates'/instructors guidance to use my existing pdf as a source of content and inspiration for user stories. However, I'd ideally like to include this project in my portfolio for job applications. And given that I am not interested in the travel field, I need to determine if I could use idea 2 to highlight any skills / perspectives / accomplishments that are relevant to the companies I hope to apply to. I am concerned that selecting project 2 will not allow me to achieve this higher-order goal. There were no pieces of critique that needed to be dismissed for this idea.

Currently, the feedback regarding idea 1 (visual information in GenAI output) feels less implementable. This is because I believe I have a differing understanding of how the site will work and the resulting technical considerations vs. the understanding of my classmates and instructors (and resulting feedback during lab). I would ideally like to pursue this project, because it is more aligned with my professional goals (designing AI products). I need to first vet the technical feasibility.

For my next steps, I'd like to do two things: have a one-on-one conversation with my lab instructor to discuss idea 1 (visual information in GenAI output) in more detail and meet with a mentor to discuss the implications of me implementing idea 2 (guest manual for client). During my meeting with my instructor on idea 1, I plan to re-state my plan for the website, and develop a shared understanding regarding the technical requirements and potential challenges. During my meeting with my mentor on idea 2, I would like to discuss what are the benefits and risks of implementing the guest manual website.
